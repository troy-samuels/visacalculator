## Breakdown of Top Countries Visiting the Schengen Zone

The provided CSV lists countries whose citizens are visa-exempt and subject to the Schengen 90/180-day rule, but it does **not** indicate which of these countries send the most visitors to the Schengen Area. To answer your question, here is a breakdown of the top non-EU/EEA countries whose citizens most frequently visit the Schengen Zone, based on recent travel and visa application data:

### Top Source Countries for Schengen Visits (Recent Data)

- **Russia:** Historically the largest source of Schengen visa applications, with over 4 million applications in 2023.
- **China:** Significant growth post-COVID, with 1.1 million applications in 2023, up from just under 100,000 in 2022.
- **Turkey:** Consistently among the top, with high application volumes each year.
- **India:** Rapidly growing, with a 29% increase in applications in early 2024.
- **United States:** The largest long-haul market for European travel, though most US citizens are visa-exempt and not reflected in visa application statistics.
- **United Kingdom:** Since Brexit, UK citizens are subject to the 90/180 rule and represent a major source of visitors.
- **Ukraine:** Significant numbers, especially in recent years due to geopolitical factors.
- **Israel, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and Canada:** All are major visa-exempt markets with substantial visitor flows to the Schengen Zone.


### Most Popular Destinations Within the Schengen Zone

- **France:** The leading Schengen destination, receiving over 3 million visa applications in 2024 and tens of millions of visitors annually.
- **Spain:** Second most popular, with about 1.6 million applications and high tourist numbers.
- **Germany:** Third, with approximately 1.5 million applications.
- **Italy and the Netherlands:** Also among the top destinations for non-EU/EEA travelers.


### Visitor Volume Overview

| Country | Type | Notable Visitor Volume (2023-2024) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Russia | Visa-required | 4M+ applications |
| China | Visa-required | 1.1M applications |
| Turkey | Visa-required | High volume |
| India | Visa-required | Rapid growth |
| United States | Visa-exempt | Largest long-haul market |
| United Kingdom | Visa-exempt | Major source post-Brexit |
| Ukraine | Visa-exempt | Significant numbers |
| Israel | Visa-exempt | High volume |
| Japan | Visa-exempt | High volume |
| South Korea | Visa-exempt | High volume |
| Brazil | Visa-exempt | High volume |
| Canada | Visa-exempt | High volume |

### Key Points

- **Visa application data** is most reliable for countries that require visas (e.g., Russia, China, India, Turkey).
- **Visa-exempt countries** (e.g., US, UK, Canada, Japan) are major sources of visitors, but their arrivals are tracked via tourism statistics rather than visa applications.
- The **CSV file** you referenced lists visa-exempt countries, but does not rank them by visitor numbers or provide a breakdown of actual travel volumes.


### Summary

While the CSV provides a list of visa-exempt countries, it does **not** give a breakdown of the top countries that visit the Schengen Zone. For business planning, focus on the largest source markets listed above, as these represent the primary visitor flows and the greatest need for visa-related guidance and tools.
